    const dimensionsData = [
        { name: "Exploration", desc: "The cognitive drive to proactively investigate, experiment, and pilot emergent AI capabilities beyond mandated workflows.", scientific: "Empirical data suggests that high Exploration scores correlate with reduced time-to-value in software deployments. It represents the 'Curiosity Quotient' applied to digital tools.", dev: "Institutionalize 'Innovation Sprints' where experimentation is decoupled from immediate KPIs. Establish safe-to-fail sandboxes to lower the psychological barrier to entry." },
        { name: "Persistence", desc: "The behavioral resilience required to troubleshoot hallucinations, non-deterministic outputs, and initial tool friction.", scientific: "Iterative persistence is the primary differentiator between casual users and 'power users.' This dimension measures the tolerance for computational ambiguity.", dev: "Reward the documentation of failure as much as success. Create a 'Prompt Library' where shared troubleshooting becomes organizational knowledge." },
        { name: "Integration", desc: "The degree of alignment between AI use and established ethical, legal, and operational governance structures.", scientific: "Unchecked integration poses systemic risk. High scores reflect an internalisation of governance as a facilitator rather than a constraint.", dev: "Embed ethics checkpoints directly into tool interfaces. Conduct regular workshops on algorithmic bias and data privacy to maintain high awareness levels." },
        { name: "Influence", desc: "Social contagion and peer-to-peer advocacy for AI adoption within internal professional networks.", scientific: "Diffusion of Innovation theory posits that 'Influence' is the engine of the majority's adoption. This measures the peer-led network effect.", dev: "Formalize internal 'Champion' roles. Implement peer-mentoring programs where high-influence individuals guide more hesitant colleagues." },
        { name: "Psychology", desc: "Socio-psychological security regarding professional identity and perceived replacement threats.", scientific: "Identity threat is the leading cause of covert resistance. This dimension tracks the shift from 'replacement anxiety' to 'augmentation confidence'.", dev: "Explicitly communicate AI as a 'Human-in-the-loop' augmentation tool. Highlight the displacement of mundane tasks to favor high-value creative work." },
        { name: "Digital Temperament", desc: "Comfort with probabilistic logic and non-deterministic technological environments.", scientific: "Classic computing is binary; AI is probabilistic. This dimension measures the cognitive flexibility required for non-linear digital interactions.", dev: "Educate staff on 'Confidence Intervals' in AI output. Shift performance metrics from 'Binary Correctness' to 'Weighted Accuracy' in experimental phases." },
        { name: "Trust", desc: "Confidence in institutional AI logic, transparency of systems, and the reliability of organizational outputs.", scientific: "Trust is a multifaceted construct involving system reliability and human transparency. It is the foundation of long-term sustainable adoption.", dev: "Promote Explainable AI (XAI) tools. Ensure leadership transparency regarding which AI systems are used and for what specific purposes." },
        { name: "Leadership", desc: "Executive commitment, resource allocation, and active behavioral role-modeling of AI proficiency.", scientific: "Organizational culture is a shadow of leadership. This measures the executive 'buy-in' through visible action and funding allocation.", dev: "Encourage leaders to share their personal AI use-cases. Implement reverse-mentoring where junior AI experts advise senior leadership teams." },
        { name: "Policy", desc: "Clarity of institutional guardrails, incentivization structures, and evolving governance rules.", scientific: "Policy lag often hampers innovation. This dimension measures the effectiveness and accessibility of the regulatory framework.", dev: "Transition from static policy documents to dynamic 'Living Guidelines'. Simplify approved tool lists with clear, tiered access levels based on risk." },
        { name: "Benefit", desc: "Tangible perception of quality, speed, or creative gains facilitated by AI tool usage.", scientific: "The 'Value-Capture' perception determines sustained usage. Without visible benefit, adoption eventually regresses to the mean.", dev: "Track and publish time-saved metrics across different departments. Highlight qualitative wins where AI enabled previously impossible creative feats." },
        { name: "Adoption", desc: "Structural embedding of AI into core daily operations and longitudinal workflow consistency.", scientific: "Adoption is the final stage of maturity, moving from pilot phases to 'business-as-usual' infrastructure. It reflects the normalization of AI.", dev: "Monitor the 'Pilot-to-Scale' ratio. Ensure that successful AI experiments are systematically converted into standard operating procedures (SOPs)." }
